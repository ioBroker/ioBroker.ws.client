# ioBroker.ws.client - @iobroker/ws

This library is used for communication with the back-end via pure web-sockets.

It simulates `socket.io` interface.

It is used normally together with `@iobroker/ws-server` on server side, and it is not compatible with `socket.io` (server) library.

## Usage

In the same way as `socket.io.client` library
